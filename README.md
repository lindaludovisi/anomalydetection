# anomalydetection

In this repository there are the following files:
* 00-takeimg.py : it is a simple python script which extracts all the frames from a video. It generates the dataset, made of frames belonging to different videos.
* hough_transform.py : it contains the code used for the class which performs Hough Lines Detection. 
* main_rectangles.py : it is the main program to generate the final dataset. Given the initial image (**frame0.jpg**), it detects the Hough Lines (**here the class HoughLineDetector in hough_transform.py is used**) and save the coordinates of the lines, which are the same for all the images. Then, the final dataset is generated by extracting rectangular shapes from the images, which refer to the products on the conveyor belt. 
* ppt_preprocessing_openCV.pdf : it is a ppt presentation showing all these aforementioned processing steps.
* ML_models.ipynb : it is the python code used for training and testing the dataset.
